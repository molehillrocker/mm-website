This repository is supposed to represent the website for my personal magic mirror project. A magic mirror is a mirror with a monitor behind, which looks like a common mirror from the front but is actually translucent from the back, allowing the monitors content to be viewed when standing in front of the mirror.

This project has been mainly inspired by Micheal Teeuws [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/80391333672/magic-mirror-part-i-the-idea-the-mirror). His code can be found on GitHub as well, see [here](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).

However, I'll try to go a different route, away from PHP and towards JavaScript and AngularJS. Let's see how it goes. ;)
