This repository is supposed to represent the website for my personal magic mirror project. A magic mirror is a mirror with a monitor behind, which is a common mirror from the front and translucent from the back, allowing the monitors content to be viewed through the mirror.

This project has been mainly inspired by Micheal Teeuws [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/80391333672/magic-mirror-part-i-the-idea-the-mirror). His code can be found here on GitHub as well, see [here](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).

However, I'll try to go a different route, away from PHP and towards JavaScript and AngularJS. Let's see how it goes. ;)
